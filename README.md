# CinemaAngularClient

This project is built for the SWENG module in my 4th Semester at HSLU.

It is still under active development along with a NestJS backend https://github.com/ZachLee12/nestjs-cinema-server

## Goals / Features to add
1. JWT Authentication with Local Strategy (maybe add Passport but not sure yet)
2. Expose GraphQL api 
3. Responsive CSS 
4. Try to mock Netflix's style, like how a trailer plays at the frontpage. 
5. Mock Payment and send confirmation email (find out how to do this)  

## Tech Stack
1. Angular
2. NestJS 
3. REST + GraphQL
4. MongoDB
5. Prisma 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
